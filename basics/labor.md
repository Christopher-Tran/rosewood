# Rosewood Labor
#### 08/12/2020

Labor in community living is similar to the personal chores one has in life. Labor in Rosewood strikes a balance between a set chore list and a free-form system. For example, one community may have a set amount of tasks that account for a number of credits (Kitchen Clean - 1hr) and everyone completes the same amount of credits/time period; others may simply have an adaptive to-do list with an expectation for members to contribute when they can. 

Rosewood uses an HP system to balance between the two. An HP system allows for adaptability to a member's life. They may choose to not contribute to the house entirely for one week and lose the appropriate HP which may be made up in later weeks.


### HP System

 - Every 30 minutes of work corresponds to 0.5HP of work. Members start with 20HP upon move-in and are granted a grace-period of one labor week to adjust.
 - You cannot go above 20HP and can only get credit for a maximum of 6 hours/week (6HP). Either cap may be lifted for a week by a house vote.
 - Members at/below 10HP go through a House Check-In (link) at the next scheduled meeting. 
 - Members at/below 5HP go through a Membership Review where their membership will be discussed. The review will end with a vote on whether or not their membership will continue. Terms may be added on to a continuing membership (i.e. Members must get back to 15 HP within a time period).
 - Members at 0HP will receive a Notice to Vavate (link).


### Rosewood Requirements

 - All members are expected to do 180 minutes of labor each week, including 1 mandatory shift of at least 40 minutes.
 - Labor should be recorded in increments of 10 minutes.
 - Labor can be physical or intellectual in nature. Examples of intellectual labor include answering emails, putting together the retreat, research, etc.
 

 ### Mandatory Labor Shifts
 - Every member does one 40 minute cleaning shift/week.
 - If a mandatory shift is not completed at the end of a week an additional 1.5HP is deducted.
 - Mandatory Shifts work in a four week cycle. Within every four weeks a member's mandatory shift must make up two kitchen shifts, one bathroom shift, and one alternative shift.
 - Alternative shifts include cleaning/tidying any area not the kitchen or bathroom. Members may also do a kitchen or bathroom shift as alternative labor if those areas need more attention than is being accounted for with the normal kitchen/bathroom shifts.


 ### Free-form Labor
 - Every member must do 180 minutes of labor each week. 140 minutes can be any labor outside mandatory labor that one would like to perform. Any task at the community that one feels contributes to its improvement.
