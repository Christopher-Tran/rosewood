# What/Why Community Housing?
08/09/2020

There is no one way to do Community Housing. But ask any "community" in the world and there is often the shared reasoning of humans are social creatures. Being a part of a group may empower people as individuals and collectives in ways that are unguided and guided. Unguided benefits of community living encompass collective power and social enrichment. Guided benefits advance these into new realms like sustainability and social mobility. A group of friends living together may decide as a group to commit to growing 50% of the food consumed; capitalizing on their collective power in a way to be ecologically/economically conscious, see Ecovillage.

A common saying among communities that embodies the benefits of community housing; and in it's spirit the saying is only common because one community shared it with others and so on. It is not just the individuals of a community that may reap collective benefits, but independent collectives are also part of the collective community of the world; and in this spirit comes the collection of these pages.
